<h2>Shine a Light Enrollment Rates</h2> 



<p> 
	Shine a Light would love to serve you children's educational needs. While also sharing with them who Christ is and how we
	should live according to his Gospel. Enrollment rates for our center are
	based on the age of the children.

	We structure our days similarly in each of our rooms with our daily schedule so that support staff can easily adjust in each room. We focus on centering our teachings, crafts, lessons, playtime, and reading time on Jesus. This looks different each day but we want each child to continue learning about Jesus through all we do at Shine a Light.
